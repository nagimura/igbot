Setup and Imports:
The script imports necessary modules and sets up environment variables:

It uses asyncio for asynchronous programming.
aiohttp is used for the web server.
dotenv is used to load environment variables.
Custom modules like instagram_api, ai_handler, reminder_bot, webhook_handler, and message_handler are imported for specific functionalities.
Environment Variables:
The script loads environment variables for VERIFY_TOKEN, INSTAGRAM_TOKEN, and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.

Logging Setup:
A logging system is set up to track the application's activities.

Main Function:
The main() function is the core of the application:

It verifies the Instagram token.
Tests AI response generation.
Starts a reminder bot.
Sets up a web server to handle Instagram webhooks.
Webhook Handling:

The setup_routes() function from webhook_handler.py sets up routes for handling Instagram webhooks.
The handle_instagram_webhook() function in webhook_handler.py processes incoming webhook requests from Instagram.
Message Processing:

The handle_instagram_event() function in message_handler.py processes Instagram events, including messages and mentions.
For direct messages, it uses the handle_instagram_message() function.
For mentions, it uses the handle_instagram_mention() function.
AI Response Generation:

The generate_ai_response() function is used to generate AI responses to messages.
Message Sending:

The send_instagram_message() function (likely in instagram_api.py) is used to send messages back to users on Instagram.
Batch Processing:

There's a system for batch processing messages, implemented in the process_pending_batches() function.
Reminder Bot:

A reminder bot is started using the start_reminder_bot() function.
Server Running:

The script sets up an aiohttp web server to run indefinitely, handling incoming webhook requests.
This application essentially acts as a bridge between Instagram's messaging system and an AI response generator. It receives messages via webhooks, processes them, generates AI responses, and sends these responses back to users on Instagram. It also includes additional features like a reminder bot and batch processing of messages.
